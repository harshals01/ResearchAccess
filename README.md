# Research Access using Micropayments

## Description
This smart contract facilitates a decentralized marketplace for academic research papers. Researchers can publish their papers with a fixed price, and users can purchase access using Aptos Coin (APT) through micropayments. This eliminates the need for expensive subscriptions and makes academic research more accessible.

## Vision of the Project
The project aims to democratize access to academic research by enabling direct transactions between researchers and readers. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, fairness, and financial support for researchers without intermediaries.

## Future Scope
- Implementing a content encryption mechanism so that only buyers can decrypt and access purchased papers.
- Enabling peer reviews and reputation-based pricing models.
- Supporting multiple cryptocurrencies for broader accessibility.
- Adding a decentralized storage solution for hosting research papers directly on-chain or via IPFS.
- Introducing a governance mechanism for quality control and dispute resolution.
